            <h3>Hi there! I'm Sebastian,</h3>
            <p className="text">
              I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer with a knack for
              problem-solving and a love for C#.
              <br />
              Whether it's front-end finesse or back-end brilliance, I've got
              you covered. My journey in tech has been driven by a simple
              philosophy: listen closely, communicate clearly, and deliver
              beyond expectations.
              <br />
              <br />
              I pride myself on being not just a developer, but also a partner
              to my clients. I believe that the best solutions come from truly
              understanding what you want and working together closely to make
              it happen.
              <br />
              As a Scrum Master, I'm all about smooth processes and
              collaborative teamwork, ensuring that every project runs like a
              well-oiled machine.
              <br />
              <br />
              Seeing my clients' faces light up when they see the final product
              is what fuels my passion. There's nothing quite like the thrill of
              solving a complex problem and knowing that it makes a real
              difference. I'm here to turn your ideas into reality, with a
              personal touch and professional expertise. When I'm not coding,
              you'll find me diving into new tech trends, honing my skills, and
              planning my next big project. Let's connect and create something
              amazing together!
